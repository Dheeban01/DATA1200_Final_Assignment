            <h2>What is web accesibility?</h2>
            <p>Web accessibility is the wide known phenomenon that a website should be accessible to as many individuals
                as
                possible (Persson et. al. 2015). A website with good web accessibility is easy to access and use for all
                people. This includes people with and without disabilities. For instance, normal people using other
                devices
                with different screen sizes, or people with visual impairments.</p>
            <p>For this assignment we attempted to remove barriers which made our website inaccessible.</p>

            <h2 id="HowDidWeTestWebAccessibility">How did we test web accessibility?</h2>
            <p>To test web accessibility, we used an automated test, <a href="https://achecker.us/checker/index.php"
                    target="blank">AChecker</a>, on all our pages. The website evaluated our
                HTML-code and gave us feedback on how we could improve our accessibility. We aimed for the grade AA or
                higher,
                since this indicated that there were no known problems with our code. </p>

            <p>Even so, we still made active decisions
                to improve our accessibility beyond what the test showed. The test also gave us a list of potential
                problems,
                which we carefully found and assessed. We fixed the ones we thought were applicable to our case.</p>

                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>According to the automated check, the navigation bar is a list of links and must be marked appropriately.
                Therefore, we encapsuled our navigation bar with the semantic tag &lt;ul&gt; and the corresponding
                &lt;li&gt; for each item on the list.
                This ensures an isolated section with information, with <strong>excellent</strong> structure.</p>

            <h4 id="SkipToMainContent">"Skip to main content" button (with link)</h4>
            <p>According to the automated check we needed a “skip to main content” button. This will elevate our pages
                because our users can easily skip to the main content. Without this button, the process of navigating
                the website could be a tedious process for various people, especially for our friends with visual
                impairments.

            <p>According to the automated check, h1, h2 are potentially used for formatting. This is not the case. We
                used our header elements as section headers to structure our different themes. We only used formatting in a
                CSS file that is separated from the HTML files that we used in the accessibility check.</p>
            <h4 id="PrimaryLanguage">Primary language</h4>
            <p>According to the automated check, our webpages should only have one primary language. However, we used
                dummy text because it was allowed in our task description. Therefore, we choose to ignore the feedback.

            <h4 id="AltTextForImages">Alt text for images</h4>
            <p>According to the automated check, we had two potential problems with our “alt” attribute to all our
                images.
                First, it assumed our alt descriptions should have been longer. Then it commented that our texts were
                too
                long. We choose to disregard both statements. Which lead to a detailed visual description for the users
                who
                cannot see them. Our alt text make it a better experience using a screen reader.</p>

            <h2 id="WebAccessibilityBeyondTheAccessibilityTest">Web accessibility beyond the accesibility test</h2>
            
            <p>We used other accessibility tests to improve our visually impaired users experience. For instance, we
                used
                strong color contrasts for our texts, images, and background images. We tested our website used an
                online <a href="https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/"
                    target="blank">colorblind test</a> to make sure
                colorblind people had no trouble seeing the different colors in our website. We also made sure to use
                the
                right sematic tags, and lines under all our links, so it would be easier to see the links properly.
                Lastly, we
                used fonts which makes it easy to read. As a result, people with visual impairments can still enjoy our
                page,
                without compromise. </p>
                <p>Another accessibility decision that we had to take was one relating to this particular page. On other pages
                    of this website we used the tag to describe the content of each picture. However, the pictures on the
                    accessibility page are of a different nature. They do not show portraits or general purpose pictures, but they
                    are pictures containing text. And not any kind of text that can be easily understood by people without the
                    appropriate background, but very technical text containing HTML code and specialized text. We are aware that
                    the <a
                      href="https://usability.yale.edu/web-accessibility/articles/images?fbclid=IwAR0pJYePWWRXRLb0D7vg4sVKBI8Ir1EgwyjB3PTAqr0w2fAHb8_I_2A7Als#images-of-text"
                      target="blank"> Usability & Web Accessibility </a> made by the Yale University advises that the &lt;alt&gt;
                    should match exactly the text contained in the picture. However, in this case we had a group discussion and we
                    decided that more meaningful than simply pasting the HTML code in the &lt;alt&gt; tag would be to describe the
                    meaning of the content in the respective text.</p>
            <p>Some other coding changes we made include correct sematic tags and attributes accordingly. We used the
                &lt;html&gt;“lang” attribute to define our primary language. Furthermore, for all our images, we used
                the
                “alt” attribute. Lastly, we used “back to main content” buttons for our website for easy “scrolling” and
                tried
                to make our website easy to navigate.</p>
