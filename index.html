      <h1> Welcome to our OsloMet experiences! </h1>
      <h2> This is a page created by one of the DATA1200 groups for the final assignment for the introduction
        to HTML and CSS course. The page contains several pages showproffing the skills that we gain during this
        particular course in our first semester of our first year with this prestigious educational instituion. You can
        brows
        the pages by clicking the desired page of the navigation bar on the top of the page. </h2>

      <p id="bioDescription">Our group formed this autumn and it contains five members. We all met as part of our TKD
        studies and even though we all come from different backgrouds, so we bonded as the unexperienced and unpriviledged students
        with no prior experience in CSS and HTML. We worked together for the two mandatory assignments that we have been
        given, as well as for this one last step in completting DATA1200. During our time together we discovered that each of us has a bit of an
        artist inside and found a commom quote: </p>
      <blockquote id="homequote"
        cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7783174-my-dear-find-what-you-love-and-let-it-kill">
        "Find what you love and let it kill you. Let it drain you of your all.
        Let it cling onto your back and weigh you down into eventual nothingness.
        Let it kill you and let it devour your remains. For all things will kill you, both slowly and fastly,
        but it's much better to be killed by a lover." (Charles Bukowski) </blockquote>
